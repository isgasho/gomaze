# Maze Game in Go + Ebiten

Playing with mazes using Go + Ebiten + fogleman/gg, based on ideas from Tetra Loops and PUCK MAZE.
There's a new game in here somewhere, I just have to find it ...

Currently you can play "ghost herding". Move the yellow blob around by throwing the ball (clicking on a tile),
and the yellow blob finds a path from where it is to the ball.
Toggle the walls around the yellow blob using the arrow keys. Try to herd the ghosts into a small area.
